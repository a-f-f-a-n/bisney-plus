Start of my react/redux/firebase journey!

Check the site here! https://bisneyplusofficial.web.app/
I ended this project so I can focus on other things like my academics and maybe even other projects.

I did learn a lot though especially with react-router-dom, styled-components (CSS), some more javascript, and little bit more of react. I should've used useState and useEffect in some cases but maybe I'll apply them in future projects

Anyways thanks for visiting this repo!


------Known "Errors"------
Yes redux logo is the icon idc
Yes it plays when you use the back button just refresh
Yes it looks really ugly on mobile, I didn't have mobile in mind but it still works
Yes the Logo viewers and header/navbar don't link to anything, I had plans for that, but I just wanted to end this project
